  "text": "Green ammonia is a new energy source that will lead the hydrogen economy with zero carbon emissions,and refers to ammonia produced as renewable energy without carbon dioxide emissions. Following the global eco-friendly trend, it is rapidly emerging as a new energy source that will advance the ‘Net Zero’,‘Carbon Zero’ goals set by countries and organizations around the world. Abu Dhabi currently has demand for green hydrogen production technology and hydrogen convergence business, and Korea has excellent green hydrogen production technology and various convergence technologies based on power generation through hydrogen. Accordingly, LTechUVC is carrying out a green ammonia production project to meet demand.",
